            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Adverſaries were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed a great while to diſpute by way of Scripture; but at length perceiving themſelues weake in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11470:10"/> cauſe, and being much diſquieted that the Scripture doth locke them vp into ſo narrow a roome, they ſpurne againſt it, labouring to make it appeare doubtfull, and without authoritie. By this meanes our Controverſies change their nature; for inſtead of diſputing by ground of Scripture, we are now led backe to diſpute of the Scripture it ſelfe, and to defend the Authoritie and Perfection of it. This is now the field wherein our Adverſaries doe ſport, and diſplay the mettall of their conceits. They accuſe the Scripture of imperfection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie, of obſcuritie and vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſſe to determine any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, calling it a dumbe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect rule, a noſe of wax, a rocke of ſcandall, a ſcabbard, that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as well a leaden, as a ſteele blade. And though Church of Rome bee partie in the cauſe, yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11470:10"/> will it bee Iudge ſupreame, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. If the Church bee Iudge, ſhee of Rome will bee Iudge, and will haue it appertaine to her to preſcribe her taske vnto her ſelfe, and to bee ſoveraigne Iudge of her owne proper dutie. Our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make the Church of Rome the Iudge infallible of her owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per infallibilitie, and that ſhee ſhall bee ſoveraigne Iudge of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the ſame Lawes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God doth judge her ſinnes. They ſticke not to ſay, that the Church of Rome is no way ſubject to the Scripture, that is to ſay, to God ſpeaking by his Prophets and Apoſtles. So on the other ſide they maintaine, that the Scripture is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Church of Rome, and ought to be regulated by the Faith of that Church. They avow that to bee the ſingular and onely Church which giueth authoritie to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11470:11"/> Scripture, and will haue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inferiour to the Church in Dignity, in Stability, in Certainty, in Antiquitie, and in Amplitude: Yea, ſo farre they proceed, that the Pope may adde to the Creed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe contrary to the Apoſtles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which God hath ordained in the holy Scriptures, and diſpoſe of his Commandements. They hold, that the ſacred Scripture bee therefore entertained and received amongſt men, becauſe the Pope doth approoue and ordaine it ſo to be: as if the Pope were more to be credited then God, ſpeaking in his holy Scriptures; or that he were no whit ſubject to the Law of God conta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In all this controverſie betweene the Scripture and the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preheminence, by this word <hi>Church,</hi> our adverſaries al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes underſtand the Romiſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11470:11"/> there be many other more ancient and more pure; namely, the Greeke, the Syrian, the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, &amp;c. and by the Romiſh church they underſtand the Pope alone, in whom reſideth the ſoveraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whoſoeuer will heere open his eyes, and not forbid himſelfe the uſe of reaſon, ſhall eaſily perceiue, that Satan by this proceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth ſlily to bring in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11470:12"/> and to vndermine the foundations of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on For by this meanes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith is not founded vpon the Word of God contained in the holy Scriptures, but vpon humane and uncertaine evidence, yea the moſt uncertaine that can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; they juſtifying the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church of Rome to be onely eſtabliſhed vpon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Romiſh Church, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Iudge, witneſſe, and party in the ſame cauſe, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make men beleeue, that the Church of Rome hath more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then the Scriptures, for ſhe her ſelfe doth ſay it.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, that the authoritie of the Scripture bee grounded vpon the authoritie of the Church of Rome, why doe they alledge unto us paſſages of Scripture to ſupport the authoritie of the Church of Rome?</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:11470:12"/>
               <p>And when inſtead of directing the Faith of a Chriſtian by the Word of God, ſpeaking in the Scriptures, they ſend him to the Church, the ſimple people are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and hindred from chooſing the beſt Church amongſt many contrary. How ſhall they chooſe? Church from the falſe? ſhall they know it in examining her doctrine by the Scripture? that may not be; for the Scripture is a Booke that the people are not permitted to reade: and our adverſaries affirme, that the Church is not ſubject or bound to the Scripture, and that the Church may change the ſame which God commaunded in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Shall they diſcerne the true Church by antiquity and ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? nor that; for the Syrian and Greeke Churches (contrary to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11470:13"/> Romiſh) are more ancient then that of Rome, deriving their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles; and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to judge in this ſucceſſion and antiquitie, infinite Hiſtories both Greeke and Latine ought to be read, wherein the people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand little or nothing: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Clergie it ſelfe, ſcarce one of an hundred is found, that hath but ordinary or competent knowledge therein. Hee that but entreth into the view thereof, ſhall diſcouer the ſeat of the Romane Pontifies defiled with hereſies and enormous crimes, yea mangled and rent with Schiſmes that are decided by ſtroke of ſword; and according to the power of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings doeth the ſcale weigh downe.</p>
               <p>Shall they haue reſpect to the generalitie and multitude? no, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt calleth his Church a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11470:13"/> little flocke, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth vnto vs, that the multitude and broad way leade to perdition, <hi>Math</hi> 7. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Shal they giue heed to miracles? no, the Apoſtle hath foretold us, that the ſonne of perdition, who is Antichriſt, ſhall come with ſignes and miracles, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9. And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt admoniſheth vs, that falſe prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall make ſignes &amp; wonders to ſeduce, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 24. Now ſeeing that ſo many falſe miracles are wrought, and the moſt predominant Courts of Iuſtice haue made many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees againſt the workers of them, how and by what markes ſhall the poore people diſtinguiſh the true miracles from the falſe, ſeeing there is no knowledge of the true doctrien declaring Gods will that we ſhould diſcerne the miracles? <hi>Deut. 13. v.</hi> 1, 2, &amp; 3. Briefly, it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11470:14"/> certaine, that the Scriptures autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie being no more the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and direction of the beleeuers faith, all Religion vaniſheth, and turneth into ſmoke, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines nothing but to beleeue at adventure, to follow the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and like blind men to lay hands on him that marcheth next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, that in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie the people are to follow their Doctors and Paſtors, for they are the men that vndertake with God for the people. What? muſt euery man beleeue the Paſtors of his owne countrey? muſt they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church wherein they are borne? ſhall man owe his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his birth, or the cuſtome of his countrey, or the ſucceſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires? If it bee anſwered, that by the Paſtors and Doctors, thoſe of the Church of Rome are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11470:14"/> therein lies the poynt of difficultie. For the queſtion is, if thoſe Doctors bee ſound and good, teachign the true way of health, conformably to the Word of God, which they conceale from the people, in denying them to reade the holy Scriptures; then are the people bound to beleeue, that theſe are good Doctors, before they know the good doctrine; and that this church is the true church, before they know or apprehend the truth. They are alſo bound to beleeue what the church of Rome beleeveth, not knowing what that Church ought to beleeue. But if it be their tenent, that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon bee aſſiſted with the Spirit of God, to bee able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the true Church; why hold they not that hee bee aſſiſted with the ſame ſpirit to diſcerne the true doctrine, and to examine it by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11470:15"/> holy ſcriptures, ſeeing that the true Church cannot bee diſtinguiſhed but by the true doctrine? for the true faith is firſt to be knowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true faithfull can be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and the true rule is to be well vnderſtood, before thoſe that follow it can be knowne. Chriſt muſt firſt be knowne, before there is poſſibility of knowing undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, what Church is truely his flocke.</p>
               <p>Adde likewiſe heereunto, that the faith of the Romiſh Doctors dependeth entirely upon the <hi>Popes</hi> faith; nevertheleſſe they (for the greateſt part) doe beleeue that the Pope may erre; and the Popes themſelues doe confeſſe the ſame, as wee haue elſewhere prooved. Yea, their errors are condemned by thoſe Councels, which the Church of Rome did allow. And it is hard to beleeue that he cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11470:15"/> erre, who boaſteth of his authority and power, to change that which God hath ordained, &amp; to diſpenſe with his commandements.</p>

For no man can extoll himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Scripture, vnleſſe it bee meerely to impugne it.</p>
               <p>Now though man fearing God, and touched with the zeale of his houſe, cannot ſee the Scriptures, (that are divinely inſpired) to bee ſo injuriouſly deſpighted, without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11470:17"/> extreme horrour and griefe; and though it bee a very prodigie or wonder of men, that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Chriſtians, but ſo powre out their hearts in invectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scripture, (whereof nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Porphyry,</hi> nor <hi>Lucian,</hi> nor the moſt capitall enemies of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name were ever adviſed): yet to us is it a ſubject of joy, and no little conſolation in the midſt of reproaches caſt upon us, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſpeake in Gods behalfe, and to defend the honour of his word, againſt men perverſly inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to defame it. For it is better to ſuffer for him, then to triumph without him.

               <p>True it is, that the ſtaine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation exceed our ſtrength, and it is no eaſie matter to ſpeake
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11470:17"/> worthily of the condigne honour belonging to holy Scripture, and with imperfect mindes to defend her perfection, it were in ſome ſort to light the day with a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and to demonſtrate the Sanne with the finger, as to endeavour to arriue at the bright evidence of the Scripture: for at all times all that wee can performe is leſſe cleare then her perfection. I hold it therefore expedient to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the light the ſcandalls and accuſations which our adverſaries doe raiſe againſt the Scripture, and to ſhew how God hath ſtrucken them with the ſpirit of amazement: as alſo to compare the wickednes and vanitie of the Romiſh Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the perfection and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie of the holy Scripture. And wee hope that in this ſo holy and juſt quarrell God will aſſiſt vs, and that he will vouchſafe vs the grace
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11470:18"/> to maintaine the honour of his Word, by ſuch meanes as are moſt agreeable to his Word: and that he who hath confounded the tongues of the builders of Babel, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the thoughts and ſpirits of thoſe that labor daily to rebuild it.</p>
               <p>In my three former Treatiſes, entituled, <hi>The Iudge of Controverſies,</hi> I haue defended the authoritie of the Scripture, and ſhewen, that our adverſaries in this cauſe haue not onely the Scripture contradicting them, but alſo themſelues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, antiquitie, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that they are not onely at variance among themſelues, but every one particularly thwarteth himſelfe. It remaines now to ſpeak of the perfection of the Scripture, and to ſhew that our Adverſaries wrongfully find fault therein, and moſt injuriouſly accuſe it of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:11470:18"/>
               <p>Theſe two Queſtions, the one touching <hi>the authority</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the other as concerning <hi>her perfection,</hi> are linked together inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably. Theſe two properties of Scripture reciprocally embrace one the other, and afford to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues mutuall ſuccour. For the Scripture it ſelfe by her authoritie maintaineth her ſufficiencie, and her ſufficiencie giveth her authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And whoſoeuer withſtandeth the authoritie of the Scripture, fighteth alſo againſt her perfection: for if the Scripture be ſoveraigne Iudge, it is deficient in nothing to judge well And it is certaine that ſhee cannot bee Iudge of poynts whereof ſhee ſpeaketh not. If ſhee bee wanting in any thing, ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour authoritie muſt ſupply her default. And if our Adverſaries haue reaſon to ſay that the Church of Rome is the rule of Scripture,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11470:19"/> for a certaine it is of that Church wherein we ought to learne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there bee any imperfection in the Scripture: but the deciſion of the queſtion touching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures authoritie, levelleth the way for us to the queſtion concerning her perfection: which ſhall bee (if God permit) this laſt Treatiſe, wherein wee defend the abſolute perfection of the Scripture, againſt the Appendixes and Additions of the Romiſh Church, which men call <hi>Traditions;</hi> yea againſt men that with a depraved ſubtiltie ſearch and hunt after defects in Scripture: like vnto Holland ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, that diſcover ſpots and ſtaines in the ſhining ſunne.</p>
               <p>When we compare the Romiſh Traditions with the doctrine of holy Scripture, they will be found not onely infinitely beneath the ſanctitie and excellencie of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11470:19"/> Scriptures, and as coales mingled amongſt Diamonds: but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, and meere inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vnder colour of addition. It will bee found, that theſe Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they deriue and make to deſcend from the Apoſtles, are forged <hi>de novo,</hi> and reſemble the Gibeonites who being very neere, ſpake as if they were come from farre. It will appeare, that theſe Traditions which men exalt in generall, when they come to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſcanning, they are but a frivolous bundle of human Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contrived for gaine, and of malicious deceits, to ſubdue the people under the Eccleſiaſtiques, and to retaine them in blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

               <p>THe fift article of our confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expreſſeth, that <hi>the holy Scripture is the rule of all veritie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all that is neceſſary for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and our owne ſalvation, whereunto it is not lawfull to adde, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, or change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby we intend not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reject all Tradition: for if there bee a Tradition that addeth nothing to the Scripture, but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth onely to maintaine her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11470:21"/> and perfection, wee imbrace that moſt willingly. Such a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is <hi>that the Books of the old and new Teſtament are ſacred and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> This Tradition is ſo far from adding to the Scripture, that on the contrary it ſayeth, that nothing ought to be added thereunto. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it without the compaſſe of the Scripture, ſeeing that it ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and reſults from the perfection of the Scripture it ſelfe; and the credit or teſtimony that a Church (bee it true or falſe) conferreth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Bookes, is but a probable and humane teſtimony, vntill God (giving efficacie to this Scripture to touch and ſtirre vp devotion) imprinteth in it a more effectuall perſwaſion. For it is not the Church that giveth faith, but the ſpirit of God that worketh in our hearts by his powerfull word.</p>
               <p>As a river that paſſeth through a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11470:22"/> towne, is ſufficient to refreſh and water it throughout, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is it behoouefull that ſome Pipe or channell ſhould conduct it from the ſource into the place: ſo the holy Scripture is ſufficient to inſtruct vs to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nevertheleſſe it muſt come to vs as it were by the courſe of ſucceſſiue Tradition. Such a Tradition addeth no more to the Scripture, then the channell addeth to the water of the River.</p>
               <p>Alſo when wee reject unwritten Traditions, we intend not to reject all the words that are not found in the Scripture, in regard that wee may there finde the matter in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and equivalent termes, and that theſe words doe add nothing to the doctrine of ſalvation contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures. Such are the termes of <hi>Gods providence,</hi> and of the <hi>Immortalitie of the ſoule.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11470:22"/> the words of <hi>Trinitie, Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall,</hi> and the <hi>Proceſsion of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> words profitably imployed by our forefathers, to make that perſpicuous which is contained in the Scriptures, and to ſhut vp he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes into a more narrow ſtrait.</p>
               <p>Alſo wee willingly admit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions which concern not the doctrine, but onely the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall pollicie, and outward order, in regard that ſuch Lawes and Cuſtomes are not given for abſolutely neceſſary, and equalled with the doctrine of ſalvation: as alſo, becauſe they ſerue not the Paſtors uſe for traffique, avarice, or ambition; and that in this order and outward pollicie there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſhoneſt, and contrary to good morality, or that may expoſe the Chriſtian Religion to ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe; and laſtly, becauſe that with theſe Ceremonies and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11470:23"/> the multitude is not exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, neither doe they divert the piety by poſtures of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or the ſpirituall ſervice by corporall exerciſe. For as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans having conquered a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, did amuſe the people with Sports and pompous Triumphes, feaſting them with their ſpoyles, whilſt they were then buſie in plotting and aggravating the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſervitude: ſo doth the enemie of our ſalvation amuſe the people by the ſplendour of Ceremonies, whilſt hee then inthralleth conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and tacitely inſinuateth ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; to which, the very inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute. For a man naturally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth rather to recreate his ſenſe, then to inſtruct his underſtanding; to behold publike ſpectacles, then heare wholeſome doctrines; to admire pictures, then edifie by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11470:23"/> good precepts; and findeth leſſe difficultie to ſhape ſtones to the image of man, then to unſhape or reforme man to the image of God.</p>
               <p>Our confeſſion then rejecteth onely the Traditions, that adde ſomething to the doctrine of faith &amp; manners contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which are given forth to ſupply that which is thought to be wanting in the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures.</p>

               <p>Reaſon would require, that our Adverſaries ſpecifie vnto vs, what are the Doctrines that are wanting in the Scripture, and that they make us a catalogue of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

Before the fourth Seſſion was held, where in was eſtabliſhed the Decree tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Traditions, ſome ſelected Doctors were aſſembled to frame this Dectee, which was for a long ſpace debated. Some interpoſing that it was neceſſary a Decree ſhould be made, wherein it ſhould be declared that all the Catholike doctrine is founded upon Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard that the Scripture it ſelfe is not to bee beleeved, but by the leaue and meanes of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11470:30"/> that miniſtreth authoritie unto it.</p>

                  <hi>Vincent Lunel,</hi> a Cordelier was of opinion to make a Decree of the authoritie of the Church, before Traditions ſhould bee mentioned, becauſe theſe are grounded upon the authoritie of the Church, and the Church is that which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

To which opinion the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats would not condiſcend, fearing that heereby the memory of the Councels of Conſtance and Baſill ſhould be revived, which haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, and definitiuely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the ſoveraigne authoritie of the Church abideth in the Councell, and not in the Pope, and that the Pope is ſubject to the Councell, and that to enter into diſpute hereon, were to ſignifie that it is not yet knowne who ſhould be Iudge.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Anthony Mariner</hi> the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, a ſage and learned man, was of opinion, that nothing at all ſhould be ſpoken of Traditions, alleaging, that without all doubt God under the old Teſtament had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moyſes</hi> to write his Booke of the Law, charging the Kings to reade it carefully, and to put a copy of it into the Arke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but ſaith, that under the new Teſtament the Scripture is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in reſpect that Ieſus Chriſt hath written his doctrine in mens hearts, without need either of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Arke, or Booke. Hee further ſaith, that if there were no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all, yet the Church ſhould looſe nothing of her perfection: It is true, that God hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden his Apoſtles to write, but ſo alſo is it certaine that they haue not written by his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is an abuſe to ſay, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11470:31"/> God hath commaunded them to write one part of the doctrine, and forbidden them to write the other. Againe he preſſeth, that if any man he of a contrary opinion, he ſhould haue too maine difficulties to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the one to declare the things forbidden to be written; the other to tell us who hath made thoſe men that came after the Apoſtles ſo adventurous and bold, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to writing that which God had forbidden his Apoſtles to write. Laſtly he ſayth, that if any man avowed it to bee chance and without expreſſe commandement from God, that ſome things haue been written, and others not, hee ſhould accuſe the providence of God, in taking no care of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a matter, and ſhould call into doubt the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit, that hath inſtructed the Apoſtles to write. For theſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11470:32"/> reaſons was he of opinion to make no compariſon of Traditions with the Scripture, ſince by this meane alſo they might paſſe over the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> an Engliſh man, and third Legat, did utterly renounce this opinion. Yet for al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which is a perpetuall rule that the Councell hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to deviſe emptie Decrees, not expreſſing the moity of the church of Romes opinion, and that in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words, to the end, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions they may make Interpretations fit for their owne turnes.</p>

But this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth now, (as cuſtomarily it doth) propoſe its doctrine in doubtfull termes, involving it ſelfe in darkneſſe and obſuritie. For whoſoever is never ſo little verſed in the writings of our adverſaries, or hath exactly conſidered the practiſe and cuſtomes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, ſhall eaſily diſcover that the holy Scripture is of no compariſon with the value and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Tradition, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted with praiſes and magnificall titles, as alſo moſt carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whilſt the Scripture is rejected and made odious to the people as a dangerous booke.</p>
               <p>I. We haue ſeene in the former Chapter, how our adverſaries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme openly, that the Pope and Church of Rome can alter the

The Prophets whoſe writings are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with vs, were extraordinarily ſtirred up to reprehend the church of that time, and to chaſtiſe the Prieſtes, the Sacrificers, and the Scribes that erred in manners and doctrine.

Was the faith of theſe Sacrificers a rule, by which thoſe divine Propheſies were to be examined, and which wee haue kept to this preſent time? Goe to then, if the prophecies were not

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:11470:60"/> ſparke is moſt of all diſcouered herein, that hauing once diſplayed (as hee ſuppoſeth) the defaults of the Scripture, hee reioyceth that ſuch defaults are therein found, and giueth God thankes for it; to the end that men finding no ſtedineſſe or certainty in the Scripture, may ſubiect themſelues to the tyrannie of the Church, that is to ſay, of the Pope, and there to find inſtruction, theſe are his words: <hi>The prouidence</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>of God to conſtraine vs yet more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully to vndergoe the yoke of the Church with humility and ſimplicity, permitteth that there bee not only ſome alteration in certaine parcels of the Scripture, and in ſome copie, but the more the bookes of the Scripture are diſperſed, the more they ſhall alter and periſh by tract of time, whether they be in originall tongues or tranſlations.</hi> Without doubt, hee that reioyceth at the deprauations which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth
<pb facs="tcp:11470:60"/> to bee in Scripture, and at the loſſe of ſome bookes, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thererein the prouidence of God, would much more ſolace himſelfe and reioyce if all the Scripture were aboliſhed. For to what purpoſe ſerveth it, if Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bee a perfect rule, more certaine, and of more authority then the holy Scripture; and if the Pope iudge ſoueraignly and infallibly of all the points of faith? for hee hath forbidden the people to reade the Scripture, as a booke not onely unneceſſary, but alſo dangerous, and that which hath made a great breach in the Popedome.</p>
               <p>The ſame Ieſuite pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with this conceit of his, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating it with often repetition; <hi>As in the third Demonſtration,</hi> when he hath ſaid, that a man cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe of the ſenſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:11470:61"/> Greeke Teſtament, becauſe it firſt was written without accents and diſtinctions (whereon depends the ſenſe), hee addeth: <hi>It is a worke of the providence of God, to ſtoope our mindes and inclinations to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of the Church,</hi> that is to ſay, of the Pope, who by conſequence, hath more authoritie then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>not that wee have dominion over your faith,</hi> 2. Cor. 1. 24. But may not wee affirme it with more probability, to be a worke of Gods providence, that hee hath ſuffered ſo many ſchiſmes and hereſies, ſo much ſimony, uncleanneſſe of life, and crueltie to haue infected the ſeat of Rome, whereby to referre us to the Scripture, to make vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe wicked guides, and to ſubject us to his holy word? and that God by his providence, hath permitted that the Popes themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:11470:61"/> haue confeſſed their owne errours? And laſtly, that the Popes ſycophants haue recorded unto us their crimes and hereſies, as I haue proved in my firſt Booke.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, to bee throughly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with what ſpirit this Ieſuite is lead, it is but to reade the ſame that hee hath written in his third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, pag. 190. <hi>They cauſe them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to renounce the Church (pretending that it conſiſteth of men that are faultie and lyers) vnder a faire ſemblance of Scripture, and vnder a plauſible promiſe to governe all by the word of God. But the truth is, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a bleare-eyed</hi> Leah <hi>vnto them in lieu of a faire</hi> Rachel, <hi>and ſubmit faith to the ſoveraigne command of the will of Miniſters, who put into their hand a Scripture that is humane, erronious, mutable, ſubject to correction, &amp;c.</hi> This miſerable Ieſuite wil one day render an account to God of ſo
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11470:62"/> damnable a ſpeech, wherein hee compareth the holy Scripture to bleare-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> and the Church of Rome to beautifull <hi>Rachel.</hi> It is very falſe that wee renounce the Church; but yet we maintaine that it ought to be ſubject to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and we renounce the doctrine of thoſe who ſay, that the Scripture is ſubject to the Church of Rome: for God cannot be ſubject to men.</p>
               <p>As for the ſoveraigne power of the Miniſters function, that might well bee retorted upon us for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, if wee boaſted amongſt us that they cannot erre, that they haue power to change Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements conteined in the holy Scriptures, to adde to the Creed, and to make new articles of faith; or if we ſhould ſtile our ſelues Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges infallible and ſoveraigne of the poynts of faith. Wee leaue theſe uſurpations, and proud titles to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:11470:62"/> Pope, by the which hee exalteth himſelfe aboue God. Onely wee exhort the people to beleeue the Word of God contained in holy Scriptures: wherein if wee finde any obſcure paſſages, wee take not upon us to bee Iudges of the ſenſe, and to determine it with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is enough, that as much as therein is perſpicuous and plaine, (not needing the helpe of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter) is ſufficient for our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And to conteſt much about Tranſlations, wee buſie not our ſelues; for the Tranſlation appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Church of Rome fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth us, diſcovering clearely ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very condemnation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry. All Tranſlations agree in the matters neceſſary to ſalvation, and the originall texts both He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greeke, are at this day familiar and agreeing to our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:11470:63"/>
               <p>Of theſe things haue I treated at large in my firſt Booke of <hi>The Iudge of Controverſies,</hi> and haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed all the ſlender objections wherein our Adverſaries doe ſide with Pagans and Infidels, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to extenuate the firmneſſe and authoritie of the Scripture, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>The divine Oracles,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. and <hi>The Scripture diuinely inſpired, 1. Tim.</hi> 3. 16. which I ſay, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe hath utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, holding vp his owne vocation by the teſtimony of the Prophets; and by it hath repelled the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deuill, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. Yea S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Scripture can make a man wiſe to ſaluation, and is moſt proper for mans accompliſhment in euery good worke;</hi> without it wee haue not meanes to know that God will haue but one Church in the world. And when our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue wretchedly reuiled it, yet
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11470:63"/> are they afterwards conſtrained to returne vnto it, and to beg of it, (though with an ill ſtomacke) ſome clauſes of Text to found their Church vpon the Scriptures au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: without it Chriſtianity had beene long ſince aboliſhed. The diuine efficacy of it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in this, that the Pope hath ſuppreſſed it, ſo as the people may not ſee it: yet when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lay it open to the peoples view, and that it be tranſlated into vulgar tongues, Papiſtry doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vaniſh in many Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Yea if Emperours and Kings had not haſtened to ſuccour, vſing both fire and ſword, and the rigour of Inquiſitions, without doubt Papiſtry had beene vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Wherefore it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if the Pope by his ſcouts la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to blemiſh the Scripture, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it doubtfull and without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11470:64"/> which vngodly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at this day borrow the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Pagans, who to reſtore Paganiſme and ruine Chriſtianity, haue had no ſurer courſe then to difſame the holy Scripture. Loe whither Satan ſtrives to leade vs: Hee ſtriues to ſhake the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian religion, to the end that the people diſtaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scripture, may for their faith and ſaluation relye vpon the conductors of the Romiſh church, wherein haue liued multitudes of Popes notorious heretickes, and ſo iudged by the Councels which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and by the Popes favorites themſelues: Wherein alſo you may perceiue to the number of three and twentie Schiſmes, and many contrary Popes at the ſame time, mutualy entitling themſelues Antichriſts. Yea wherein haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11470:64"/> many infamous Popes, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancers, Adulterers, Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, aduanced to the Popedome by whores, by Simony, and by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. Such as take vpon them the title of God, cauſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee adored, and Kings to kiſſe their feete, and the Scripture to bee proſtrate before them when they enter into the Councels; ſuch as vante they cannot erre, that they can make another Creed, can change Gods ordinances, can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſoules out of Purgatory into Paradiſe, and ranke whom they pleaſe in the Catalogue of Saints by canonizing them: vnder colour whereof they exerciſe an abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable commerce and trafficke by Diſpenſations, Abſolutions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Annates, Licences, and Benefices. So as from a poore Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of a Citie, who was no way eminent but in martyrdomes, the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11470:65"/> Pope is become a puiſſant tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Monarch ſurpaſſing in riches the greateſt Monarchs of the earth. To effect ſo great an alteration, it was needfull that Religion ſhould bee changed: for the purity and plainneſſe of chriſtianity regulated by the Scriptures, could not ſerue to build vp ſo great an Empire.</p>
               <p>Theſe things haue I amply han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in my firſt Booke, wherein I maintaine the Authoritie of the Scripture. Which work went then forth almoſt the very day that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite <hi>Regourds</hi> Booke againſt the Authoritie and Perfection of the Scripture was publiſhed. Theſe two Bookes if any man will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare together, ſhall finde that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere all that hee pleadeth againſt the authoritie of the Scripture; and that <hi>Regourds</hi> Booke ſatisfieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all that I propoſe in mine. Before that he publiſhed his book,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11470:65"/> a Challenge was brought to the Paſtors of this Church of Sedan, to enter into conference &amp; diſpute with ſome Doctors, amongſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Ieſuite <hi>Regourd,</hi> wherein they threatned us. Wee accepted the Conference: the place and day were aſſigned, with all accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that after ſo many Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances every mans honour ſhould oblige him not to recant. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe hee durſt not appeare, and for two ſeverall times failed at the day appoynted. But his humour ſerving him at laſt to diſpute, and being thirſtie of reputation, hee went ſome where elſe to diſcharge his choler, and in Conference ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon <hi>Monſieur Meſtrezat,</hi> where he received all ſort of diſgrace, ſo farre forth as his friends were faine to make uſe of ſuperiour power to draw him from the combate, and to hinder the Conference from

And ſo retired this wittie Doctor, as well contented as ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, being not ſo wiſely adviſed but to make trophies and ſignes of victory, conſidering there were ſo many witneſſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> A Proofe of the ſame by the practiſe of the Primitiue Church.</head>
               <p>WEe haue proved by many paſſages of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that in the Church of Rome, Traditions are much more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and of greater authority then the Scripture, which they ſo much under-value, and charge with a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11470:66"/> thouſand reproaches; and that by injuſtice and moſt fraudulently the Councell of Trent ſeemes to make them equall. Now are we to proue the ſame by the practiſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In the firſt place, when our adverſaries ground the authority of the Scripture upon tradition of the Church, and would haue the Scripture received and beleeved, becauſe the Church doth ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine it; It is evident that they preferre Tradition before Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for they make Scripture to depend upon Tradition, &amp; eſteeme Tradition of the Church more worthy of belife then Scripture, and beleeue not the Scripture, but becauſe the Church of Rome hath ſo commanded it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Let vs looke vpon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and wee ſhall informe our ſelues, that in the Church of Rome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11470:67"/> the people is a thouſand fold more carefully inſtructed in Tradition, then in the doctrine of ſalvation contained in holy Scriptures. The moſt ignorant know the meaning of Lent, and the foure Seaſons: they are inſtructed in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meats; they are skilled in Feſtivall dayes and Eues; they goe in Pilgrimage, viſite the Reliques, gaine Pardons; purchaſe Maſſes, Obits, and Suffrages for the dead; ſpeake of Purgatory, mumble over their Chaplet or Beads, and their Roſary, or our Ladies Pſalter; and diſcourſe of the Popes ſucceſſion in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, but they are ignorant in the holy Scripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it modeſtie and humility not to enquire much after it. Aske them upon the doctrine of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Ieſus Chriſt, upon Iuſtification by faith, vpon our free Adoption, upon the correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11470:67"/> betweene the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, upon the difference between the old and new Teſtament, upon the cauſes wherefore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that our Redeemer ſhould bee God and man in the vnitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vpon the ends of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion, upon the Doctrine of faith and good works (which are the poynts wherein conſiſteth the eſſence of Chriſtian Religion) and you ſhall finde them as mute as fiſhes, and altogether uninſtructed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Baptiſme is a divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but Confirmation (ſuch as is practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) and confection of the Criſome, are humane Inventions. Yet are they much more honoured then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: for in the Church of Rome a woman, yea a Pagan and Iew may baptize, and giue that which they haue not: and Confirmation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11470:68"/> is not adminiſtred, nor Criſome conſecrated but by the Biſhop, with great ſolemnitie.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe reaſons that haue moued the Pope to exalt Tradition aboue the Scripture are three. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The one is, becauſe the ſucceſſion of the Pope in the primacie of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is a Tradition, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prop of his dominion. And therefore it neerely concernes him to exalt Tradition, vpon which his Empire is founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is, becauſe Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depend vpon the Pope, and as hee contriued them, ſo can he alter them. But hee hath not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his power; he cannot make another holy Scripture; nor change the Hebrew originall which the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11470:72"/> Iewes (who are not obedient to him) doe carefully preſerue; nor the Greeke Teſtament, which the Greeke Churches haue ſaued for vs. It concernes him therefore that the Traditions (whereof hee is both Maker and Maſter) be had in great eſtimation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is, becauſe all Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are gainefull to the Pope and Clergy, and ſerue to extoll the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Empire, and dignity of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks: hee and his Clergy rake vp infinite profit by Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, priuate Maſſes, Suffrages and Maſſes for the deceaſed, Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Annates, &amp;c. By confeſſions the Prieſts know the ſecrets of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, &amp; make themſelues formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, in reſeruing the participation of the chalice to themſelues and Kings, they make themſelues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of Kings, and worſhipfull to the people: by Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <hi>power of making God with words, to create their Creatour, and to haue Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt within their juriſdiction, loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up in a Pix.</hi> By the ſacrifice of Maſſe, they make themſelues ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Prieſts, ſacrificing Ieſus Chriſt to his Father. By the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of feſtiuall dayes, the Pope vſurpeth power in commanding al ſhops to be ſhut vp, and cauſeth all Seſſions of iuſtice and Councell to be interrupted at his pleaſure. By the difference of meats, he gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Markets, Kitchens, and Tables of Kings. By the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of Saints, hee makes his meaneſt groomes to bee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the people, and lifteth up to heauen thoſe that haue moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved him; and commandeth the people to invoke ſuch Saints as hee pleaſeth. By the Sacrament of Penance, he impoſeth corporall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11470:73"/> and pecuniary penalties &amp; mulcts, yea upon Kings and Princes to the very whipping of them, uſurpeth ſway over bodies and goods, and changeth corporall puniſhments into pecuniary. By the Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, the Prieſts make themſelues Iudges betweene God and the ſinner, and will haue God obliged to pardon a ſinner, becauſe the Prieſt hath pardoned him; yea in a cauſe where God is the partie offended, the Prieſt maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe judge. Whereas God in the holy Scripture giveth to Paſtors power to diſpenſe with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinnes as far as Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cenſure, theſe gallants make bold as far as the Conſcience, and to the very judiciall Seat of God. By Service in Latine, the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the people in ignorance, and planeth among all Nations a marke of his Empire, giving them
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11470:73"/> the Romane language to ſubdue them to the Romiſh Religion. The Diſpenſations which the Pope gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to Princes, to marry in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees forbidden by the word of God, doe oblige the children that ſpring from them to maintaine the Papall authority; for if that were ſhaken, it would bee doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee legitimate or no. The power of diſ-enthroning Kings, diſpoſing of Empires, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their feet to bee kiſſed by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narks, canonizing Saints, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing ſoules out of Purgatory, are Traditions which magnifie the papall dignity, aboue all power ſpirituall or temporall that ever was on earth. Wherefore let vs not maruell that the Pope laboureth to countenance theſe Traditions, and to cruſh the Scripture, which doth but moleſt him, diſaccommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date him in his traffique, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11470:74"/> ſtaggereth his whole Empire.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Reader that hath heard the compariſon, which our aduerſaries make of Tradition of the Romiſh Church, with the holy Scriptures (ſaying, that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church is more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, more ample, more cleare, more certaine, and of more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over vs then the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) will call to remembrance the example of the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who paſſing by long rankes of columns and pillars and by magnificall Temples, did lead the Worſhipers to a place more ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and retired, where ſtood the God of the Temple; there did they ſhew them an Ape, or an Oxe, or a Cat, in honour of whom the Temple was erected, even thus doe our aduerſaries in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After ſuch high titles and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of Traditions (to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11470:74"/> extolling of them aboue the word of God, contained in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) when wee come to vnmaske their vglineſſe, and offer them to ſight, they preſent vs with abſurd inuentions, and ſuch as expoſe Chriſtian religion to laughter. They tell vs of Images of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in wood or ſtone. Of ſoules that broile in a fire for ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Of Indulgences for one hundred yeares. Of priuileged Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, vpon which whoſoeuer cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Maſſe to bee ſaid, maketh choiſe of a ſoule to be releaſed out of Purgatory. Of Adoration of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, bones, and rags. Of ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Maſſes without communicants, which chant after the intention of him that payes them. Of publicke prayers and particular in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue. Of maſſes for horſes. Of Ieſus Chriſt caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by mice. Of bleſſed beads, and

                  <hi>Agnus Dei.</hi> Of pilgrimages. Of the difference of meats. Of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſatisfactions. Of faſting and being whipt one for another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Traditions, ſee what is preferred before the Scripture, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Lawes and documents which they balance with the Law that God himſelfe hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and with the doctrine of our redemption, which the eternall Sonne of God hath brought from Heauen, and yet is found light in compariſon of theſe venerable Traditions; for why? becauſe they caſt into the ſcale a maſſy ſtone, to weet, the names of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which in the hearts of men growne brutiſh, weigh downe againſt God and the Scriptures.</p>

               <p>THe Traditions of the Church of Rome are of ſo great a number, that a meere Catalogue of them would furniſh out a large volume. The whole rabble of them hath theſe three maximes for their foundation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Pope is Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the charge of Head of the univerſall Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in the faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Apoſtles haue not ſet downe in writing all that they did teach by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>Hee that will comprehend the nature of theſe maximes, ſhall know
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11470:81"/> that they evert the Chriſtian faith, and conſume all Religion into ſmoke: for if the Maximes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Papiſtry is founded, and all the body of Romiſh Traditions, bee imaginary maximes and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane, (not to giue a worſe phraſe) it is impoſſible that the Religion which is built thereupon can haue the leaſt tittle of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt maxime that layeth downe <hi>the Pope to bee Saint Peters Succeſſor, in the charge of Head of the vniverſall Church,</hi> is deſtitute of all teſtimony of Gods Word; and our. Adverſaries to vphold it, produce nothing but humane teſtimonies. Whence it followeth, that it is not an Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and that it cannot be beleeved for a certaintie of faith, for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith is grounded upon the Word of God: <hi>Faith commeth by

               <p>I forbeare to cenſure any further

               <p>Now it is an eaſie matter, to gueſſe, at what the proceedings of the Enemy of our ſaluation doe levell. Their butt &amp; ſcope is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill (as it were) all Religion into a vapour, and to make it depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſuppoſitions, not only vaine and vncertaine, but alſo falſe and imaginary: as he that ſhould beare vp an obeliske vpon a ſmal feskue. When ſome demand, <hi>Wherefore is it behouefull to receive Traditions?</hi> the anſwere is, <hi>becauſe the Pope hath ordained it.</hi> Againe, if it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>whence commeth this authority of the Pope?</hi> it is anſwered, <hi>Becauſe Saint</hi> Peter <hi>dying hath left the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>Succeſſour of his Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, over the Church of the whole world.</hi> Moreouer when it is asked, <hi>Can you produce any Ordinance of God for this ſucceſsion; for this point being eſtated by you, for the foundation of the Church,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11470:85"/> and of all the Chriſtian faith, it is not credible that God hath ordained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it?</hi> there they ſtand caught by the noſe, not vttering one ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the word of God, and doe confeſſe, that this ſucceſſion is not <hi>lure diuino,</hi> nor by the Ordinance of God. Only the Popes will bee therein beleeued, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſupreme and abſolute, in a caſe wherein they are ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed, and wherein it is diſputed of their ſucceſſion and authority. Thus you may ſee all the <hi>Ius diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> founded vpon a point which is not <hi>Iure diuino;</hi> and all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine doctrine founded vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition, yea vpon humane Teſtimony, the moſt vncertaine of all, for the certainty of the Popes ſucceſſion is founded vpon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and authority of the Pope himſelfe, who is party in this cauſe, and who by this Tradition ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

               <p>Nay, they doe worſe, they make not onely theſe Traditions, but the very authority of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to depend vpon this Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Maxime is of the ſame nature, and dependeth vpon the firſt.

For they will haue the Pope Succeſſour not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the power of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo of his infallibility.</p>
               <p>Now if the Pope ſhould be Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of the Supremacy of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it followeth not thereupon that the Pope cannot erre; for hee that is Succeſſour of the charge of another, is not therefore Succeſſor of his vertue.

And ſeeing that our adverſaries confeſſe that there haue beene multitudes of profane Popes and of infamous life, it is hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that hee which is not Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of the good life, and of the vertues of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> can be Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour infallible of his purity in the Faith. For if the wicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Leaders of the Church bring in errours, their vngodly life bringeth in profaneneſſe and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme;

As the Pope is the onely Chriſtian Prelate which maketh himſelfe to be called God, ſo is he the onely creature which qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe with Infallibilitie, to the end to make him reſemble God. Imitating heerein the falſe Doctors who taught the Iewes to ſay: <hi>The Law ſhall not periſh from the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 18. 18.</note>

               </p>
               <p>It is not requiſite to prooue this Maxime any further, <hi>That the Biſhop of Rome cannot erre in the Faith,</hi> to bee falſe and contradicted (in the experience of ſo many ages) by ſo many holy Doctors, who haue ſo often condemned the Biſhops of Rome; by ſo many Councels, damning the Romiſh Church, and the Biſhop of Rome for error and hereſie; by the teſtimony of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11470:90"/> of our adverſaries, who reject this Maxime; and by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Popes themſelues. This hath beene amply prooved in my firſt Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Vpon which ſo falſe a Maxime, are grounded all Traditions of the church of Rome, as a multitude of flies ſitting vpon a floating planke; or a number of Chymera's hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a ſpiders thread, which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at a blaſt. It is their plaiſter for all evill. They make new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith moſt gainfull to his Holineſſe. Idolatry, Merchandiſe, tyranny, corruption of the benefit and nature of Ieſus Chriſt is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. And in concluſion they pay us with this maxime, that the Church cannot erre; and by the Church they underſtand the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; and by the Romiſh Church the Pope of Rome. Thus the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church forbiddeth all ſorts
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:11470:91"/> of errours by an errour, in ſaying, <hi>I cannot erre,</hi> ſupplying with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that which is wanting in reaſon. Shee is exempted from giving reaſon of her doctrine, for ſhee her ſelfe judgeth that ſhe hath reaſon. Such an errour is the worſt of all; for by this meanes a man becommeth Iudge of the Word of God, and maketh Religion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his will. And hee that ſaith, <hi>I cannot erre,</hi> will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his errour, nor ſubiect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to any rule; for he beleeveth himſelfe to be the Rule. How ſhall he be raiſed vp, who beleeveth hee cannot fall?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Maxime whereon our adverſaries ground their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath no more certaintie, then the other two precedent. They preſuppoſe without proofe, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many things which they did not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11470:91"/> commit to writing.</hi> Vpon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſition they build another, the moſt inconſiderate and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that can bee. For they would haue it beleeved, that thoſe things which the Apoſtles did not ſet downe in writing, are the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Romiſh Church at this time; and therefore conclude, that when Ieſus Chriſt ſpake ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and apart to his Diſciples, he conferred with them about the ſervice of Images, and adoration of Reliques, about Indulgences and ſuperaboundant ſatisfactions of the Saints, which the Pope ought to locke up in his Treaſury; about Invocation of Saints, about the crowning of his Mother in the dignitie of Queene of heaven, and of the Angels; about private Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Communion vnder one kind, bleſſed Beades, &amp; <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> &amp;c. This is a daring conjecture,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:11470:92"/> whereon if the faith of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bee founded, all Religion ſhall conſiſt of ſuppoſition: and the Pope ſhall haue good recreation to invent Traditions which ſhal turne to his profit; for ſuch conjectures are taken for Oracles, and layd downe for a foundation of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>But they are aſhamed of this, and *contradict themſelues: for knowing that theſe Traditions are new Inventions, they ſpeake freely that neither Chriſt nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue taught all, either by mouth or by writing, and that the Popes from time to time haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many doctrines eſſentiall and neceſſary, reſerving to themſelues the power of altering that which God hath comanded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of adding to the Creed, of diſpenſing againſt the Apoſtle, and of eſtabliſhing new Articles of
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:11470:92"/> faith, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> we haue ſhewed by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of proofes, &amp; by the practiſe of the church of Rome. So as now wee are not to conſider what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines haue been taught from the mouth of the Apoſtles, but it is endeavoured to make us receiue all the Traditions which the Popes haue added, not onely to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but alſo to the preaching of the Apoſtles, for inviolable lawes and infallible rules.</p>
               <p>Our adverſaries then come back to this, that the Church of Rome cannot erre in her Traditions, for ſhee cannot erre in this Tradition, that <hi>ſhee cannot erre.</hi> They would haue us beleeue the Tradition of the Romiſh Church, becauſe the Tradition of that Church hath ſo ordained it. So as this third Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime leadeth vs backe to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which holdeth, that <hi>the Pope cannot erre:</hi> and this Maxime that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11470:93"/> the Pope cannot erre, leadeth us to the firſt, that is to ſay, to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> (wherof God ordained nothing) from whence they haue made this infallibilitie to ſpring forth.</p>
               <p>It is lamentable to heare, how they ſpeake of the antiquitie of their Traditions, yea, when they be freſh and moderne. They heard their fathers ſay, that they heard from others, and they againe from others, that the Apoſtles haue taught theſe things by mouth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and did diſperſe them amongſt ſome few. Thus they make a brittle cord which bindeth not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and their beleefe ſtriving to rove backe through fifteene or ſixteene ages, wherein they ſee not one jot, is loſt in the way; in ſtead of beginning at the fountaine, to wit, at Ieſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and to learne in their writings
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11470:93"/> that which they haue taught: for, a Commandement of the Lord, or of the Apoſtles, had in one word freed them from all doubt and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie.</p>

               <p>For the firſt, I ſay that prayers<note place="margin">1. Prayer for the dead.</note> for the Dead, which the Romiſh Church doth exerciſe, and are made for the comfort of Soules in Purgatory, are ſo moderne as not to have any mention or trace of them in all antiquity. For wee have already expreſſed, and will further demonſtrate in its proper place, that the ancient Chriſtians prayed for the dead, ſleeping in a peaceable repoſe, and kept in hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den receptacles, expecting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; praying likewiſe that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:11470:109"/> the dead ſhould riſe againe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or that they ſhould be raiſed at a better houre then others, or that the fire at the laſt day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould burne them more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially and ſparingly, but for a prayer to eaſe and mitigate a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoule in the fire of Purgatory, there is not any found in all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: yea, in all the prayers of the Church of Rome, which are found in the Maſſe for the dead, there is not ſo much as any whiſpering of Purgatory; and yet the Canon of the Maſſe prayeth for the ſoules that ſleepe in peaceable quietneſſe: and at this day the Greek and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Churches pray for the dead, and deny Purgatory. The ſecond booke of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> at the 12. c. wiſheth us to pray for the dead, having reſpect to the reſurrection, ſaying likewiſe that to pray other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then thus, were trifling and

               <p>I have inſiſted hereupon, not that wee ſhould have need of the authority of the ancients, to fight againſt Romiſh Traditions, (for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation whereof, the word of God
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:11470:112"/> is ſufficient, and is only that which ought to judge us:) but to ſhew that our Adverſaries, ſuppoſing to eſtabliſh their Traditions, doe plainely deſtroy them, and doe giue ſuch notes, whereby they draw their owne inditement and conviction.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe it is not without craft, that they will have Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to bee examined by this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: to wit, whether they have beene univerſally received at all times. For they know, that of thoſe who would examine their Traditions by this way, ſcarce one amongſt a thouſand can attaine to the head of them, and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can inform themſelves nothing at all therein: for this examination cannot bee made, but by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all the Greeke and Latine Fathers, and of all the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hiſtories ſince the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11470:113"/> of ſixteene hundred yeeres. All the bookes to this purpoſe would fill a ſpacious roome, and are no more then ſealed letters to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea amongſt the Clergie, not one of a hundred will bee found that hath but ordinary knowledge therein. By this meanes our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries contrive the matter, that when their Traditions come to be examined, a way muſt bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that is endleſſe, wherein the people walke blindefold, and are conſtrained to repaire to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſuch men as preach theſe Traditions, and live by them: truly if by theſe directions men expect to arrive at the knowledge of ſalvation, I know not who can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The which moſt cleerely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being the ſhort and ſure means to examiue Traditions, they ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

It appeareth likewiſe in the examination of Traditions by the hiſtory of every age, wherein ordinarily they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence with the laſt age, and ſo walke retrograde in the calculation of their times, to the end they may arrive as late as poſſibly they can at the Apoſtles time and their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>

               <p>To diſcerne the good Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the bad, our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries agree, that thoſe ought to be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:11470:114"/> held for divine and Apoſtolicall, which are received by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that derive their ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>This marke hath no more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty then the former, and maketh as much againſt our Adverſaries. The doubtfulneſſe of it is manifeſt in this, that the Churches of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, of Alexandria, of Epheſus, of Theſſalonica, of Candia, &amp;c. (which are contrary to the Romiſh Church, and more ancient) doe boaſt themſelves to bee of equall ſucceſſion, and one part of them challengeth a ſucceſſion from Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> yea before the Churches of Alexandria and Antioch did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any interruption, by the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Mahumetans, they were often in diſcord with the Church of Rome, and were not in any wiſe ſubject unto it: and more particularly, the Church of Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:11470:114"/> founded upon Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Church of Candia where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> eſtabliſhed <hi>Titus,</hi> (from whom deſcended the Biſhops of Candia) keepe a ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, which never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, and hath continued ſince the time of Chriſt, who ſpeaking from heaven, ſent the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> yet notwithſtanding theſe Churches are ſeparated from a communion with the Church of Rome, and the Pope holdeth them for Schiſmatickes and Heretikes.</p>
               <p>As for the Biſhop of Rome, ſo many ſchiſmes dividing, and ſo many hereſies tainting his Seat, (as our Adverſaries themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and we have elſewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) have long ſince broken the ranke of this imaginary ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>Alſo the uncertainty of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion betrayeth it ſelfe, in that it is a meere tradition, ſo as if the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:11470:115"/> of Images, or the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under one kinde, be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſucceſſion; behold then Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions founded upon a Tradition, and this Tradition founded upon humane hiſtories, which may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, yea often doe jarre and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: wherefore this is an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty founded upon another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, as atomes and motes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon the aire.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall a Mechanicke, or a woman know this ſucceſſion? How ſhall they be aſſured that the ſecond Biſhop of Rome hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in the points of Religion as the firſt, the third as the ſecond, the fourth as the third, and ſo for ſixteene hundred yeeres, though there never might have happened any alteration? Who doth not perceive that theſe men, by a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble falſhood invent projects, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they know that the knowledge
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:11470:115"/> is impoſſible, and wherein the ſearch is a labour in vaine, to the end that the ignorant finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muffled up in darkneſſe, may catch hold and graſpe the hand, which theſe men ſtretch forth to them, to be conductours of their blindneſſe?</p>
               <p>Yet let us briefly obſerve, what this ſucceſſion of the Church of Rome may ſignifie or bee: they bring us clauſes of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, reporting the Biſhop of Rome to be Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor; and ſhew a Nomenclature of the Biſhops from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to this day: but we finde that the ancients make ſuch another Catalogue of the Biſhops of Ieruſalem, and of Antioch, whoſe ſucceſſion is of greater antiquity then that of the Biſhops of Rome. The Biſhops of Alexandria likewiſe draw out their ſucceſſion from Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:11470:116"/> But our Adverſaries will not have this ſucceſſion to be eſteemed, for (ſay they) thoſe Churches are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, and yet the ſame Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches alſo call the Church of Rome hereticall and ſchiſmaticall. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then lieth the point of difficulty, the ancients reckon up the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in Iernſalem, in Antioch, at Rome, and at Alexandria: but they meane not they ſhould bee Succeſſours of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtleſhip, they meane onely in the governement of ſuch and ſuch a particular Church, planted by one of the Apoſtles. So, putting the caſe that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> founded the Church of Rome, and was there Biſhop, (which nevertheleſſe is doubtfull and miſtruſted) I will alſo agree that the Biſhops of Rome of the firſt ages have beene Succeſſours to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:11470:116"/> the Biſhopricke of the Church of the city of Rome onely. In the ſame manner as <hi>Simon</hi> was Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame manner to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle in the Biſhopricke of Ieruſalem, and <hi>Timothy</hi> Succeſſour to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the Biſhopricke of Epheſus, but not in his Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries profit nothing by their allegations, if they prove not firſt by teſtimonies both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and irrefragable, that God hath ordained Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to have a Succeſſour in his Apoſtleſhip, and that the Biſhop of Rome was Succeſſour to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in the dignity of the head of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church. For ought not this ſucceſſion to have come from God? Did God eſtabliſh a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame and ſucceſſive head over the Church of all the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any mention of it in his word? And did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:11470:117"/> forget to ſpeake of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, from whence we have two long Epiſtles? See then whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſtand, and how our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are taken. All their Religion is founded upon this Tradition, to wit, that the Pope hath beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained from God, to bee the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in the charge of head of the univerſall Church; hereunto they bend their force, this is the ſcope of all the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. And yet concerning this Tradition, they cannot produce one poore divine truth, nor one ſingle word out of the word of God: yea, when it commeth to humane teſtimonies, it is apparant that they are contrary to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall ſucceſſion of the Pope of Rome.</p>
               <p>In one thing our Adverſaries finde themſelves much incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: We demand of them, when

               <p>To which wee anſwere, that when God ſpeaketh from heaven, or ſendeth Angels to inſtruct men concerning his will, the Scripture might eaſily be neglected: if at this day God ſpake from heaven, and publiſhed his Oracles from above, as hee ſpake heretofore to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Patriarchs before <hi>Maſes,</hi> we ſhould not ſeeke for any other inſtruction. But this is no more; and God having fully imparted his will unto us, by the writings of his Prophets and Apoſtles, we are obliged to follow the meanes, wherewith his goodneſſe hath furniſhed us. and it is neceſſary to bee bound and compelled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:11470:127"/>
               <p>I ſay, the ſame of the Church in the Apoſtles time, whil'ſt it was cleerely illuminated by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and miracles of ſo renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inſtruments of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who were inſtructed by God in all verity; thoſe people which were taught by their mouth, made no great eſteeme of their writings: but God having inſpired them to leave in writing the effect of his will, wherein he had well tutered them, and they having not left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them one perſon of like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and knowledge, nor that hath the Spirit of God in equall meaſure; nothing remaineth more for us, but to be inſtructed by their writings, wherein the Apoſtles ſpeake unto us, and their word is yet alive and full of efficacie ſince their death and departure.</p>
               <p>It is a profane preſumption, or affected negligence, to ſpeake of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:11470:128"/> theſe writings (divinely inſpired) as of unneceſſary ſcripts and ſcroles: for they which talke that language, doe it for this end, to withdraw the people from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reading thereof, as from a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous buſineſſe, and for the end to diſtribute the rules therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unattentively and in hugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mugger. Shall we call them unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meanes. which God hath choſen to informe us concerning his will? The which if they were not abſolutely neceſſary of their owne nature, yet they are made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary by the will of God, and by the counſell of his providence: for hee hath left but this infallible meanes to inſtruct us. And men that ſpeake in the Chaires may erre, they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubject to avarice and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the two ports thorow which errours doe enter by troops and

               <p>And truly whoſoever ſhall know what was the eſtate of the Romiſh, church, ſome ſix ſcore yeres paſſed, and how it conſiſted only in fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Legends, in adoration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, in miracles made by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in vertues and perfections of the Frocke or Cowle of S. <hi>Francis</hi> and Saint <hi>Dominick;</hi> and that Ieſus Chriſt ſcarce appeared amongſt the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>, and that the holy Scripture was utterly eſtranged &amp; unknown; will eaſily acknowledge, that the maine barre which hath hindred Papiſtrie, that it ſhould not paſſe into Paganiſme, (whereinto it was running poſt) hath beene, that theſe holy Bookes were drawne forth of darke ignorance, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the vulgar Tongues.

For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to their objection, that wee receive this unwritten Tradition, to wit, <hi>Theſe bookes are canonicall;</hi> to ſay ſo much of the bookes, is not to adde to the canonicall bookes. And ſpeaking in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we are ſo farre from adding to Scripture, that on the contrary, it is a declaration that nothing is to be added thereunto, and that it is the perfect rule of our faith. Yet to have a complete certainety of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:11470:142"/> ſacredneſſe of theſe bookes, there muſt be a ſtronger teſtimony then this Tradition. An illiterate man not inſtructed in the knowledge of God, receiveth the teſtimony of the Church of his owne countrey, which telleth him that theſe books are canonicall, as a probable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and which hee ſhould not willingly contradict: but then hee beginneth to have of it a divine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and of ſoveraigne effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, when the Spirit of God by the Doctrine contained in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath enlightened his ſpirit, and inflamed his heart with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertue, whereof it is in vaine to diſpute with thoſe that feele it not: the which cannot ſerve for a Law to another but ſerveth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the faithfull in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to aſſure his conſcience. It is alſo to bee conſidered, that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſhewing ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:11470:142"/> bookes to bee canonicall, might proceed as well from an hereticall as from an orthodox Church. The Apoſtles received the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Phariſes and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who were enemies to Ieſus Chriſt. Whence it appeareth, that the teſtimony which the Church affordeth to the Scriptures, is not of ſupreme authority and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but invalid. It is by faith that we beleeve, that the contents of the Scripture are the word of God; which faith is not given by the Church, for it is an effect of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Touching the other points, I ſpeake of them in generall, that if they bee Doctrines and Rules of the Chriſtian faith, not contained in the Scripture, we are not bound to beleeve them. But when every one of theſe points ſhall be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſunder, ſome will bee found
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:11470:143"/> contained in the Scripture, others are not Doctrines, nor Lawes or Rules of the Chriſtian faith, nor things requiſite or neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>I am aſtoniſhed to behold how our Adverſaries dare to inſert the Baptiſme of little infants, amongſt the unwritten traditions, ſeeing that their ſelves diſputing againſt the Anabaptiſts, prove it by many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his eighth Chapter of the firſt Booke of Baptiſme, bringeth theſe proofes of Scripture, that Baptiſme ſucceeded Circumciſion, which was applied to little infants.

               <p>As for holding Baptiſme of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes to bee good, wee account not this article as neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Agrippine</hi> a man of holy life and Doctrine, and Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint <hi>Firmilian,</hi> Saint <hi>Denis, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> have diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this point, from the Church of Rome; yet nevertheleſſe they are held for Saints by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Yea more, many Councels approved by the Church of Rome ordaine, that ſome Heretikes ſhould be re-baptized, by name the Paulianiſts, the Samoſetanians, the Montaniſts, the Eunomians, the Sabellians, the Eucratites, &amp;c. as is

If it be moreover ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:11470:151"/> to the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, it ſhall follow, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles (who have written ſince the Prophets) are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. I will anſwere that the Apoſtles have written the ſame things that the Prophets have written, for as much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſubſtance of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they have added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto much more cleereneſſe and light.</p>
               <p>4. Yet the ſame Apoſtle at <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27. ſpeaketh to the <hi>Epheſians, I have not ſhunded to declare unto you all the counſell of God.</hi> Whereupon it followeth, that the eſſentiall things of faith, which <hi>Salmeron</hi> formerly told us were added ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, and not taught of them either by mouth or by writing, are not of the counſell of God.

               <p>It would bee impertinent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that by the ſame reaſon it ſhould bee ſaid, that the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> are not of the counſell of God, becauſe they were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>5. At <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. and 12. 3. God ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Ye ſhall not adde to the word which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it.</hi> Hee doth not ſay, you ſhall not change or alter any part, or you ſhall not teach any thing to the contrary: but you ſhall adde nothing, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:11470:152"/> diminiſh nothing. As to diminiſh &amp; defalſe ſomething from the Law of god, is not to foiſt in a contrary c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Put the caſe it were not forbidden to adde, and that it ſhould bee ſpoken thus: <hi>You ſhall change nothing of my word,</hi> yet the Pope would ſtill be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having infringed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, by attributing to himſelfe the power of changing the Lawes and Ordinances of God, and of diſpenſing againſt the Apoſtle. In the bookes of the hourely prayers of our Lady (according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Rome) the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God are placed in the entrance. The third is couched in theſe termes, <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath and feſtivall dayes.</hi> Can any thing bee more plainely added to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? Therefore if it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:11470:153"/> were prohibited to adde to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (without which was then no Doctrine of ſalvation) there is no colour or appearance that at this time the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles are not ſufficient, and that it is lawfull to adde unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereunto. And let it not ſeeme ſtrange, that the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> alone were then ſufficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation: for whoſoever will examine the books of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who did ſet forth their writings afterwards, ſhall finde that they adde nothing to the Doctrine of ſalvation, which is contained in the bookes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> onely they adde ſome confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory examples of the promiſes and menaces of God, ſome hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the chaſtiſements, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deliverances of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is true that Ieſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles have ſince given a more ample inſtruction: but I ſay that whilſt the Church had no other divine bookes, but thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were ſufficient to ſalvation: for the Church ought to be contented with that meaſure of knowledge which God hath revealed.

               <p>7. None of our adverſaries durſt yet deny, that the doctrine of the Goſpell is ſufficient to ſalvation, or gaine-fay that the Goſpell is found whole and entire in the new
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:11470:155"/> Teſtament. Otherwiſe the title were falſe, and we ſhould be forced to change the inſcription, and ſet it downe <hi>part of the Goſpel,</hi> untill the <hi>Pope</hi> doth publiſh the ſecond part; or elſe bee compelled to ſeeke the other part of the Goſpel in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word, which is not to bee found. For our aduerſaries would never ſuffer it to bee compiled and reduced into one body, nor doe they divulge any booke which is called <hi>the word of God,</hi> except the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Some anſwere, that the bookes<note place="margin">Iehan Iau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert. p. 308.</note> of the Goſpell, which are in the new Teſtament, doe containe all the Goſpel but implicitely, that is to ſay, after an involued and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled manner, the force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath extorted thoſe words from them, for if the ſervice of Images, adoration of Reliques, Pardons of one hundred thouſand

Thoſe that extract oyles and ſalts, out of the ſtones, would idly imploy their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein. For to ſpeake in generall, without any ſpecificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Scripture approoueth Traditions, is but a mockery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this vaile or ſhaddow, there is neither tyranny, nor idolatry, nor bartering traffique, but may abound, and bee practiſed in the Church, preſuppoſing without proofe, that theſe are the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Scripture meaneth, for the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo iudgeth of them, who cannot erre in the Faith,

               <p>8. I affirme the ſame of the title of the whole Bible, being called <hi>the Teſtament</hi> or <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> which Title muſt bee changed, if the Scripture be but a part of Gods Teſtament.

               <p>It is objected, that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe hath added to that which hee did preach, when he wrote more Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles after that to the Galathians; and that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> after him wrote the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accuſed.

               <p>Our Adverſaries being repulſed from this refuge or ſtarting hole, finde out another, and ſay that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth thoſe who taught <hi>other then,</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi> to that which hee had taught concerning the Doctrine of the Goſpel: but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe hath not ſet downe all in writing which hee hath taught: this is that which they ſay without proofe or reaſon.

               <p>But thoſe of our adverſaries who are better ſtored with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as <hi>Thomas, Bellarmin, Baronius, Perron, Salmeron</hi> &amp; <hi>Vaſques</hi> rejecteth this wrangling Philoſophy &amp; fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reaſoning, which carpeth at ſyllables, and is made for nothing elſe but to bring foorth nothing, and to brave and ſwagger in the ſpeed of running away.</p>
               <p>Now, what an unjuſt caſe it is, that thoſe who attribute to the Church of Rome the power not only of adding to the Scripture, but alſo to alter that which God hath ordained in the Scripture, and who hold that their Church hath no obligation to the Scripture, ſhould uſe ſuch rigor againſt us, to bind us preciſely to the words and ſyllables of the Scripture: though wee change nothing in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It were an eaſie matter for vs to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:11470:164"/> proceed againſt them after the ſame wiſe: replying to the firſt word they offer us, <hi>Shew mee what you ſay in as many words in the word of God written or unwritten,</hi> for they take both for the rule of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And if they make uſe of theſe words <hi>therefore</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> to tell them, theſe are your reaſons and conſequences; and in ſtead of giving ſatisfactory anſwere, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them that they proove unto us, that wee are bound to proove to them what they demand: and ſo to breake off with laughter and inſultation, this were the way (as the proverbe hath it,) to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet the fooles with mad-men.</p>
               <p>If in handling points of the Faith, it be not permitted to make uſe of other wordes beſides thoſe that are found in the Scripture, it ſhall not be ſuffered to preach, nor to write commentaries, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:11470:165"/> the paſſages of the Scripture together: for this collation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee made without imploying ſome other words, which forme the compariſon, and ſhew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. It ſhall not likewiſe be ſuffered to recite the Creed, nor to ſay there are but foure <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> in the new Teſtament: for the Scripture ſpeaketh not this in ſo many words.</p>
               <p>Moreover by this pedanticall cavilation, neither <hi>Charles</hi> nor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> nor any particular man, ſhall bee obliged to beleeve in Ieſus Chriſt, nor to obey him: For the Scripture neither ſpeaketh of <hi>Charles</hi> nor <hi>Anthony.</hi> But the duty of particular men is drawne by neceſſary conſequence, from the generall rules that are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>So our adverſaries beleeve that <hi>Pope Vrbane</hi> is lawfull ſucceſſour
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:11470:165"/> in the ſupremacie of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> which nevertheleſſe they derive by conſequence of this generall Maxime, <hi>that the Biſhops of Rome are lawfull ſucceſſors in the Primacy of S.</hi> Peter. If from an imaginary Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they draw conſequences, why ſhould not wee draw them from the holy Scripture?</p>
               <p>When I ſay that <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the primacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> are Traditions, whereof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh no mention, how ſhould I ſhew this in ſo many ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, ſeeing I hold that it is not found therein at all? for if there were found a paſſage that ſaith, there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the Scripture ſhould make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Theſe men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame, as when I ſhould ſay, that nothing is ſpoken of Ieſus Chriſt in <hi>Virgils Aeneades,</hi> ſome trifling Sophiſter urgeth mee to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:11470:166"/> ſhew in the <hi>Aeneades,</hi> a paſſage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that Ieſus Chriſt is not therein mentioned.</p>
               <p>This peeviſh wrangling, no leſſe injurious then troubleſome, taketh from the Chriſtians, all meanes of proving to a lew, by the Prophets, that Ieſus is the Chriſt, for the name of Ieſus Chriſt is not found in the Prophets; yet certaine it is, that the thing it ſelfe is therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in equivalent termes.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, in ſuch jugling The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, it is impoſſible to prove by Scripture, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t an <hi>Ape</hi> or <hi>Cat</hi> is not to be adored: for this is not found <hi>totidem verbis</hi> in the Scripture; but it is drawne from neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of paſſages, wherein God alone will be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>If I ſay that the ſoule is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and that God governeth the World by his providence; will theſe venerable Doctors take mee
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:11470:166"/> by the throate, to ſhew them this ſillabically in ſo many wordes? Indeed it is not found in the ſame words, but in ſome other equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpeaking of the life eternall, in this manner: <hi>God maketh all things according to the counſell of his will.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 5. <hi>And a ſparrow fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the ground without the will of God</hi> Matt. 10. 29. And God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pronounceth: <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will accompliſh all my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> Eſay 46. 10.</p>
               <p>If the Scripture ſaith that God deſcendeth, or runneth, or is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with choller, or ſleepeth; ſhall it not be lawfvll to uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plaine and intelligible words in expounding theſe figures?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I find not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> but I have found the word three; Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> telling us that <hi>there are three in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father, the Word, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:11470:167"/> the Holy Spirit.</hi> 1. Iohn 5. 7.</p>
               <p>I find not in the Scripture, <hi>toli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem verbis,</hi> that the ſoule of the thiefe was not in <hi>Limbo.</hi> But I find that Ieſus Chriſt aſſured him, <hi>Thou ſhalt this day bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find not in the Scripture in the ſame termes, that the Saints know not our hearts, but I find there, how <hi>God alone knoweth the hearts of men.</hi> 2. Chron. 6. 30.</p>
               <p>There is no mention made of ſingle life of Prelates, in the ſame words, but there it is ſayd. <hi>Let a a Biſhop bee huſband but of one wife.</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Furthermore Ieſus Chriſt diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the devill, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 11. told him; <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Which is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the 6. of <hi>Deut. 13.

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:11470:167"/> him, and ſwere by his Name.</hi> To which paſſage, the Lord joyneth another of the 1. of <hi>Sam. chap. 7. 3. Subject your hearts to the eternal God, and ſerue him alone.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt made no ſcruple or difficulty to ſpeake the ſame thing in ſundry phraſes.</p>
               <p>At the 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. It is related that <hi>Apollos</hi> a <hi>lew,</hi> demonſtrated by the Scriptures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Ieſus was the Chriſt, though it bee not therein expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſo many words.</p>
               <p>And <hi>S. Peter</hi> at the 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 43. ſpeaketh thus. <hi>To Ieſus Chriſt give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his name, whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Yet this is not found among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in expreſſe words, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent termes, and by neceſſary conſequence.

               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>S.

Yet theſe very menwho forbid us to diſpute, doe make arguments (after their manner) to the which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to give anſwere, by the ſole words of the Scripture. For we are conſtrained to ſay, <hi>I deny the major,</hi> or <hi>the minor,</hi> which are words not ſo much as touched in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>What man, but a ſenſleſſe, is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that when two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſoddered together as they ſhould bee, the concluſion or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence muſt neceſſarily follow?
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:11470:172"/> And this is not an invention of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> but a worke of God, and a naturall impreſſion; for peaſants make good arguments, though il accommodated.</p>
               <p>If of two propoſitions in an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one bee drawne from the Scripture, the other be knowne by the ſenſe, and allowed by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, the concluſion ſhall follow of neceſſity. As for example; ſpeake according to Scripture, that <hi>every man is a lyer.</hi> To this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Iadde another well knowne by the ſenſe, and confeſſed by the Adverſary, <hi>Philip is a man,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the concluſion that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>therefore Philip is a lier,</hi> cannot bee denied, but by ſome witleſſe Idiot, and ſuch a one as will not ſticke to contradict himſelfe, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that which neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, upon the propoſition which he hath confeſſed.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:11470:172"/>
               <p>And to the end it may not bee thought, that this Concluſion hath no certainty, but by vertue of the two propoſitions, I ſay that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a formall ſyllogiſme, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion <hi>Philip is a lyer</hi> is contained in that propoſition <hi>every man is a lyer:</hi> juſt as one crowne is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ten, though there bee no man to ſay it.</p>

               <p>It is true (ſay theſe men) that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon may be deceived; and they ſay true.

               <p>SEeing that in matter of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, and the points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, the <hi>Fathers</hi> doe unanimiouſly cleaue to the ſole word of God, contained in the Holy Scriptures, it were a ſtrange thing if after this, they ſhould ſeeke to ground themſelues upon Traditions, and to ſurmiſe in matter of ſalvation, another word unwritten. Certainely the Doctors who ſhould deſtroy that which
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:11470:187"/> they have built vp, ought not to be beleeved, by no meanes ſhould they bee credited, who credit not themſelues.</p>
               <p>Now for the better purging of<note place="margin">Three ſorts of good Traditions.</note> them from this blame, it would be neceſſary to remember that which wee have formerly ſpoken, to wit, that we reiect not all ſorts of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for the Scripture it ſelfe is a Tradition, which is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond is, becauſe there are Traditions which are not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, nor neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but cuſtomes, and regle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, touching Eccleſiaſticall policy: which wee willingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove, when wee ſee that they have beene receiued in the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church by a generall conſent. And <hi>Satan</hi> having alienated any one of theſe cuſtomes, and turned it to Idolatry, or converted it to any other end unpractiſed before, wee
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:11470:188"/> doe not beleeue that in deſerting ſuch a cuſtome, Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a whit impaired; but it were wiſely done to barge up that gate againſt the devill. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are alſo Doctrines taught in the Scripture, which are there not found in the ſame termes as the Ancients propoſe them, but are therein found in equivalent words, or are deduced from thence by neceſſary conſequence. If any man will call theſe doctrines <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> wee will not quarrell him thereupon, provided that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch Traditions to be botto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the Scripture, and there to be found in ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, as often as the Fathers mention and give way to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their meaning is of thoſe three ſorts afore recited: that is to ſay, either of the Scripture it ſelfe; or of cuſtomes and reglements of

Yet can there not bee a more proper paſſage alledged to confirme the ſame which I have ſaid concerning the Traditions which the Fathers have handled, that they are not Doctrines of faith, nor matters neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but onely Ceremonies, and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:11470:194"/> Cuſtomes, and Lawes of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall policie, which the Church of Rome hath forſaken for the moſt part, and regardeth them no more. For all the Traditions of <hi>Tertullian</hi> are but Cuſtomes and Ceremonies; whereupon hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>Diſciplines,</hi> and there is nothing therein which concerneth the Doctrine of faith, or is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation. And concerning the queſtion which he diſcuſſeth in this booke, whether a Chriſtian ſouldier at a day of muſter, when all the ſouldiers were crowned with a Lawrell, did better in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to ſuffer martyrdome, then to put the crowne upon his head, contenting himſelfe to hold it in his hand; I ſay it is not a point of faith, but an opinion wherein <hi>Tertullian</hi> had but a few to ſecond him. For the other Chriſtians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed this ſouldier of temerity,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:11470:194"/> and to have drawne perſecution upon his companions in a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, ſaying, That there was nothing in the Scripture that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to it.

               </p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, let vs conſider what benefit our adverſaries can derive from this paſſage, about the which they make ſo much bruit and clamour. In the firſt place, <hi>Baſil</hi> maketh a recitall of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he affirmeth to bee of equall authority with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet amongſt them there are many not approoved by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as prayer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to kneele on the Lords day, and from the <hi>Paſchal</hi> to <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Moſt eſpecially it diſpleaſeth our adverſaries, that <hi>Baſil</hi> in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> putteth the conſecration in the prayer or in the invocation (that is to ſay, in ſpeaking to God) &amp; not
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:11470:199"/> in the bread. If they beleeve <hi>Baſil,</hi> why doe they reject his Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? or if they beleeve him not, why will they oblige us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, all theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions (except the laſt) numbred by the Authour of that booke, are but ceremonies and lawes of Eccleſiaſticall policy, not neceſſary to ſalvation, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to mutability, and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently make nothing to the purpoſe. For our diſpute is not of Traditions that concerne not the Faith and Chriſtian doctrine, but of thoſe that concerne the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation, not contained in holy Scripture. Yet I cannot diſſemble, that the author of this booke (be he <hi>Baſil,</hi> or whatere he bee) isgreatly miſtaken in his not onely equaling, but alſo prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (both in height of dignitie,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:11470:199"/> and profoundneſſe of myſtery) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine petty ceremonies, before the Sacred doctrine of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contained in the Goſpel. Can any man without unſufferable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury (not to uſe a more rigide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation) equall, ye preferre the Cuſtomes of ſtanding at prayer on certaine dayes, rather then kneeling? Of praying towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> rather then towards the <hi>Weſt?</hi> And of giving a benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the water or oyle, before the doctrine of the incarnation of the Sonne of God, the benefit of this death, the juſtification by Faith, the election eternall, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeale of the Spirit of God? Can any man without impiety change any part or particle of theſe doctrines? But as for thoſe ceremonies, they have ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church it ſelfe hath diſparaged and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:11470:200"/> them. You ſee how prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and groſſe our adverſaries are, who inſtead of covering the faults of thoſe graue <hi>Fathers,</hi> doe arme themſelues with their droſſe and refuſe, as birds that liue on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but caterpillers.</p>
               <p>And touching the laſt unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tradition, which is, that men ought to beleeve in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in Ieſus Chriſt his Son, &amp; in the holy Ghoſt; Is it poſſible that <hi>Baſil,</hi> where doe ſhine ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertues and perfections, never ſaw this in the Scripture? For Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſaith, at the 14. of Saint <hi>Iohn, You beleeve in God, beleeue alſo in me.</hi> And in the 5. chap. 23. <hi>To the end that all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father.</hi> And as touching the holy Ghoſt, how oft times is hee called God? therefore when the Scripture bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to beleeue in God, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:11470:200"/> to beleeve in the holy Spirit. Now to excuſe <hi>Baſil,</hi> we muſt ſay, that hee calleth Traditions the doctrines that are not found in the Scripture in expreſſe words, but are there in ubſtance, and in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent words. And wee doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly entertaine ſuch kind of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

For the Church of Rome prayeth only for the ſoules of Purgatory, to the end their torment may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged, or conſummated.

And laſtly, he hath drawne to himſelfe a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that hee had not formerly, but only in the Biſhopricke of Rome, which was a particular Church.</p>
               <p>This is our beliefe; that the things neceſſary to ſalvation ought not to bee aboliſhed, by reaſon of the abuſes which are, and may bee thruſt into them, but we muſt take away the abuſe, and returne to the fountaine, which is the word of God.

                  <hi>Peter</hi> over the univerſall Church: vpon which Tradition they make all religion to depend. Yea they maintaine that the Church is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not only vpon Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo vpon the Popes that are his pretended ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>They ſtuffe our eares with Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, with religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Images, and with adoration of Reliques, which are Traditions that ſhake and totter the ſervice and religious adoration due to God alone, and doe eſtabliſh arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian faith, to weet, that the Saints doe know our hearts, and that wee muſt imploy them for mediators, and that they can heare our prayers effectually.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe doth the Church of Rome tell us, of ſuperaboundant ſatisfactions of the Saints, which the Pope gathereth into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church, and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:11470:214"/> them amongſt others by his Indulgences. This Tradition uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in three new articles of faith. The firſt is, that man by his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflictions, can ſatisfie God more then his ſinnes doe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The ſecond is, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the ſatisfactions of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for payment of our ſinnes. The third is, that God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Pope, to bee diſtributor of the ſatisfactions of another, and commandeth him to gather them together into the treaſure of the Church. What is all this but a new Goſpell? Certainely if theſe Traditions be true, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a booke very imperfect in the principall materialls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith. For what is there more important then the remiſſion of ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Alſo the Tradition of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke vowes layeth downe this
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:11470:214"/> Doctrine, (which is a new article of faith,) to weet, that man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme workes of ſupererrogation, that is to ſay, more good workes, and more perfect then thoſe which God hath commanded in his Word.</p>
               <p>I ſay as much of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under one kind, wherein is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded the abridgment of the moity of the Sacrament inſtituted by the Sonne of God. Not to ſpeake of ſo many other Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are not only additions to the Scripture, but meerely dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrall contradictions to it.</p>
               <p>This alſo is worthy of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that when the Fathers doe rehearſe ſome examples of unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions, they doe not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe of the Romiſh Church at this time, but others that the Church of Rome hath diſeſtemed, and obſerveth not: as prayer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:11470:215"/> the Eaſt; The prohibition of faſting on the Lords day; The cuſtome to pray ſtanding on the ſame day, and from the Paſchall to Pentecoſt; The cuſtome of taſting the milke and hony after Baptiſme, and not to bee waſhed ſeven dayes after; The prayer for the deceaſed Saints, to the end they may be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at a happyer houre, and in their ſleep of reſt they may find refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with ſuch like matters which the Church of Rome hath pretermitted, (becauſe they ſerved not the Popes turne) but hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented others, that are more gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and better accommodated to the profit and exaltation of the Pope, and all the Roman Clergy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ann lib. 3. <hi>In corruptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima republt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca plurima leges.</hi>
                  </note> is very true, that the worſt and moſt corrupted Republiques are thoſe, which have moſt lawes. For in the ſame proportion that vices waxe ſtrong, the lawes alſo are multiplyed: eſpecially when the Lawes themſelves become vices, and miſchieſes are applyed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
               <p>If this bee true in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, much more in Divine, and in the Doctrine of ſalvation. It is certaine that in civill affaires po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity inſtructed by experience, hath often redreſſed the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, changing them into better, and hath cured old evills with new lawes. But as for the Doctrine of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:11470:216"/> ſalvation delivered by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this will admit of no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without infinite impiety. It is not for Subjects to adde to the lawes of their Soveraigne, nor for Men to preſume to bee wiſer then God.</p>
               <p>It will be found that all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which men have added to the Scripture, are ſo many infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law of God, which under the colour of adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, doe overturne that which God hath eſtabliſhed; and are ſo many artificiall meanes, through a glorious pompe, to dazell the eyes of the People, and to amuſe them, whilſt they are ſeduced; and laſtly to enrich and exalt the Clergie. For the Prelates of the Church of Rome carneſtly bent to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, have taken ſufficient notice, that the Goſpell in its ſimplicity could not ſerve to build up their Empire.</p>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:11470:216"/>
               <p>And although this numberleſſe rhapſody of Traditions ſhould not bee woven by a fraudeulent worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip yet the confounding mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of new ordinances ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the old, and cauſeth that things neceſſary cannot bee diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from ſuperfluous, and that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſcarce knowne among the Saints: and the abſurdity of many new inventions by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, doe call the ancient Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines into ſuſpicion, and weaken their certainety. Eſpecially when they make the true knowledge of Divine doctrine, to depend upon the authority of humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and God to bee beleeved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men have ſo ordained it, as it is now practiſed in the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Adde to this the inclination of man to worſhip his owne proper inventions, and to till and improve
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:11470:217"/> that moſt induſtriouſly, which hee himſelfe hath planted. For as the earth nouriſheth nettles which her ſelfe hath produced, much better then good plants that are ſtrange and brought from farre: ſo the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man is reſtleſſe in taking care, that the lawes be obſerved which he of himſelfe hath invented, much more then thoſe which Ieſus Chriſt hath brought from heaven; eſpecially when theſe new Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are gainefull to the projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and a prop to their dominion. Hence it commeth to paſſe, that in the Church of Rome, the doctrine of the Goſpel (which conſiſteth of rules few &amp; eaſie) is a claſped book to the people, and the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are of little moment; but the Traditions (though toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and almoſt innumerable) are moſt religiouſly obſerved, and with marvellous obedience.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:11470:217"/>
               <p>Amongſt all the Religions that ever were in the world, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in multitude of Lawes and Traditions beareth the Bell away, the number of them being ſo great, as ſcarce an age will ſuffice to learne them. And it had beene very requiſite, that when the Councell of Trent did eſtabliſh Commiſſaries to attend the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of prohibited bookes, it ſhould have eſtabliſhed other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers immediatly, to collect toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the unwritten Traditions, and to put them in order: for ſeeing that by the authority of this Councell, the Romiſh Traditions were declared, to be of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Scripture, it was convenient that theſe Traditions being digeſted into a body, ſhould have beene annexed to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the end to have the body of Chriſtian Religion entirely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:11470:218"/> But they gave their minds to be neglectfull in this point, for feare of affrighting the people with many myriads of Traditions, of prodigious length: as alſo leſt the people ſhould compare the vanity of theſe Traditions, with the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and excellence of the holy Scriptures, which our Adverſaries hinder to bee read, with all their might and diligence. Moreover, our Adverſaries doe ſay, that the Pope and the Church of Rome can adde to the Creed, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh new Articles of faith. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth, that if Chriſtian Religion may ſuffer yet more addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to bee matters eſſentiall, the Fathers did vainly labour to make a perfect body of the Chriſtian Religion, ſeeing that it is as yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
               <p>I (being moved with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which doe altogether
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:11470:218"/> hinder them) did deſigne with my ſelfe, to make a collection of all the Traditions of the Church of Rome, and to lend helpe to their negligence. But being entred ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, I perceived the labour to bee endleſſe, and was overwhelmed with the multitude. It hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to mee, as to thoſe that ſettle themſelves in an evening to count the firſt ſtarres that appeare, and whilſt they are counting the firſt, others appeare, &amp; then more, ſo as all their reckoning is interrupted. This labour increaſing underhand, dulleth the edge of a mans deſire, and ſo much the rather, ſeeing there is no man but is ſoone weary of gathering uſeleſſe droſſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If I were diſpoſed to make a perfect Catalogue of the Romiſh Traditions, it would bee neceſſary for me to decipher, and paint forth
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:11470:219"/> the infinite diverſity of Maſſes; the Services and Suffrages of the dead; the Rubriques and Proviſo's to ſupply the defects of the Maſſe, ariſing either from ſome defect in the perſon of him that celebrateth, or from the place, or from the time, or from ſomething in the matter, or in the intention.</p>
               <p>It would be needfull for me to inſert all the lawes touching the adminiſtration of the Seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the diſciplines of the Romiſh Pontificallity, that direct the collation of the ſeven Orders. The Conſecration of the Biſhops, the Archiepiſcopall garment, the benediction of Abbots, Abbeſſes, and Nuns; the Dedication of the Churches, the Conſecration of the Altars, whether fixed or porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; together with the veſſell and moveables of the Church and Churchyards: the reconciliation
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:11470:219"/> of the Churches and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, in caſe of pollution, by effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, or by other diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt act, or by the interrement of an Hereticke: the benediction of the Images, Croſſes, Corporalls, Reliques, Bels, and Standards: the Conſecration of the Chryſme, and the Fonts; the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Excommunications, and Reconcilements of Penitents on Maundy Thurſday: the forme of Degradings and Exorciſmes, the ſingle and double ſhaving, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite variety of Monkes and their Orders, &amp; of the divers priviledges and ſpirituall graces, which the Pope hath granted unto them.</p>
               <p>It would like wiſe bee needfull for mee, to repreſent the lawes of the booke of holy Ceremonies, wherein the forme of the Popes Obſequies and Funerals, and of the Election and Coronation of a new
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:11470:220"/> one is preſcribed. The ſubmiſſions which the Kings owe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion that is made at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at the Feaſt. The Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Emperor by the hand of the Pope, with his ſhamefull homages and ſubmiſſions to his Holineſſe. The benediction of the Knight of the Church. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Roſe on our Lords day <hi>Laetare,</hi> and of the ſword on Chriſtmas night. The Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Agnus Dei.</hi> The Creation of Cardinals. The power of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Legats. The Order of the Conſiſtory, and of the Conclave, and of the Councel when the Pope is reſident there in perſon, or by his <hi>Nuntio's.</hi> The Papall Maſſe, and how the Pope receiveth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. The Popes Habits, his Epiſcopall Miter, his Royall Crowne, and a thouſand the like things, whereof the very names
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:11470:220"/> doe terriſie us, and the Lawes and Diſciplines, for quantity, doe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the Bible in thickneſſe.</p>
               <p>It would have beene needfull, to adde a thouſand villanous and ignominious precepts, touching buſie and unchaſte interrogations which the Confeſſors make, &amp; the determinations touching the caſes of conſcience. But modeſty hath hath not permitted it, and I was loath to ſtaine my booke with ſuch infamous rules, which teach vices under the ſhadow of examining and reprehending them.</p>
               <p>Therefore to put ſome bounds to this trouble, I have contented my ſelfe to bring traditions which concerne the Doctrine, that is to ſay, which in ſome ſort thruſt at the Law of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, &amp; that concerne the Sacraments, and the Orders, and the Eccleſiaſticall charges, with
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:11470:221"/> ſome ſuperſtitions where the abuſe is moſt groſſe and apparant.</p>
               <p>I have drawne all theſe Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the publike practice, from the Councels approved by the Popes, from the text of the Maſſe it ſelfe, and from the Decrees, Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and Extravagants of the Popes. And from ſome of the more famous Authors, as <hi>Lombard</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> two Princes of the Schoole, <hi>Bellarmine, Vaſquez, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> of Valence, <hi>Tolet, Emanuel Sa,</hi> that are Ieſuites, <hi>Navarre</hi> the Popes Penitentiary: the three later I quote moſt often, becauſe they maintaine their ſayings by a multigude of other Doctors: ſo as under the name of one Authour, I alledge many.</p>
               <p>All ſuch as have hearts diſpoſed to learne, ſhall here ſee with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, mixed with griefe, (as in a ſmall contracted table) the whole
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:11470:221"/> maſſie body of Papiſme, varied with a hundred thouſand colours, and ſhall be able thereby to profit. For the ſimple recitall is enough for refutation, and to leade foorth into view the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
